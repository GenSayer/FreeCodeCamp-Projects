# FreeCodeCamp-Projects
This repo is a list of FreeCodeCamp projects I have done in order to earn my certifications. May add more as I progress through the curriculums.

**WARNING**: Do **NOT** copy any of the projects listed in my repo for your own FCC projects, as that breaks academic honesty policy and if I catch you, you will be reported! However, you can use myt personal portfolio webpage template for your own personal portfolio, just don't use it for FreeCodeCamp.
